skills/value: 
  
  - Simplification. I strive to make things simpler than they are, using diagrams, pseudocode and talking to a rubber duck. 
  - analythical thinking. Using logic to approach troubleshooting is something I have been doing for a while, from sound engineer, through to assisting onsite engineers and now in software development. I find the process very satisfying.
  - good design and simplicity in mind. I look at my code and always ask if a future developer (including myself) will be able to easily understand it and make changes.
  - strong communicator, both at makers and Environ. Respect and treasure other people''s point of view. Love pair programming.
  - fast learner. Not only do I love learning, but I also strive to get to a working understanding of a new concept very fast. I then go on to further increase my knowledge. 
  - Can always do/will not give up attitude. wheel good pizza?
