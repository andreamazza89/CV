I am **curious** about most things. This drives me to learn more everyday and deepen my understanding of what I already know. I have come to appreciate and actively seek **feedback** as this helps me improve faster, both as a person and a developer. I am allergic to any code that _is not_ well crafted, clean, clearly named, modular and **simple**. If I work on a codebase with any of these attributes, I do my best to leave it in a better state than I found it.

**Passion** is what drives me. I have moved away from a successful career in high-end residential home automation to pursue my passion for software development. There is nothing I like more than a challenge and the immense satisfaction of solving a problem.

Having graduated from [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com) -a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp-, I look forward to joining a company where I can make a difference as a junior developer, contributing with my skills and **positivity**. I subscribe to **Agile/XP** values, and would like to carry on pairing and test-driving development in my work as a software engineer.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinking - Problem solving

  * _Simplicity_ | Strive to simplify complex tasks/concepts by breaking them down into smaller/simpler units. I use plain English to solve a problem at an abstract level first, then translate into code, test-driving the development.
  * _Diagramming_ | Extensive use of diagrams to map out systems/concepts I face to more easily reason about them. See [this link] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations/tree/master/diagramming_presentation) to a workshop I wrote on the subject and ran for Junior students at Makers Academy.
  * _Calm and focus_ | Approach problem solving with focus and calm; I am able to take a step back and take a fresh approach when necessary.
  * _Troubleshooting_ | Have troubleshooted several systems, both as a Maker and in my previous roles as Live Sound Engineer and Design Manager. No matter the system under the lens, I use logic to methodically get to the root of the issue.
  * _Scientific approach_ | Follow a scientific method by observing the problem, then formulating hypotheses, finally testing them in order of most likelihood. 

#### Clean code

 * _Continual improvement_ | Take pride in the code I produce and always ask myself if it could be made simpler, more efficient and easier to understand.
 * _Modular code_ | Endeavour to write code that is easily extensible and reusable, most often choosing modular over monolithic. I wrote about this in a [blog post] (https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/11/i-smashed-my-headphones-and-now-i-am-a-better-programmer/).  
 * _Meaningful names_ | Attention to detail, including choice of names. I carefully pick the clearest, most descriptive and least ambiguous name I can think of, trying to put myself in the shoes of future developers. 
 * _Good quality_ | Have recently been asked and wrote a blog post about what I deem 'good quality' in code. Here is a [link to the post](https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/what-is-good-quality-code/). Highlights: Simplicity | Human-readability | Modularity | Ease of change | Squint test.

#### Communication

  * _Human interaction_ | Pair programming is one of the best things ever discovered. I balance assertiveness and humbleness to yield the best code out of the pair. Multiple humans are so much better at solving a problem than a single one is. See an [article I wrote](https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/04/good-programming-good-people/) about this.
  * _Flexibility_ | Am capable of adapting to the person I am relating to, with experience in a variety of contexts, from ultra-high net worth individuals as a Project Manager, through to Architects as a Design manager and peer programmers at Makers.
  * _Shared knowldege_ | Enjoy teaching/mentoring as a means to self-improvement and to enable others in growing their knowledge and refining processes.

## Community

Together we are stronger, and by helping others grow, we grow as well.

As a member of the community I have both enjoyed learning from passionate senior developers and giving back as much as I can.

* Coaching volunteer at [Codebar] (https://codebar.io/), a non-profit initiative running workshops for underrepresented groups. 
* Arranged and ran workshops for junior students at Makers Academy. See [this link] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations/tree/master) to my presentations.  
* Member of the London Software Craftmanship Community. Evening pairing sessions are my favourites.
* Frequently attend meetups to learn, hear about new technologies and exchange opinions. See a [post] (https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/18/meetups-are-the-bomb/) I wrote on this.
