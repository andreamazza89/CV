I am **curious** about most things. This drives me to learn more everyday and deepen my understanding of what I already know. I have come to appreciate and actively seek **feedback** as this helps me improve faster, both as a person and a developer. I am allergic to any code that _is not_ well crafted, clean, clearly named, modular and **simple**. If I work on a codebase with any of these attributes, I try to leave it in a better state than I found it.

**Passion** is what drives me. I have moved away from a succesful career in high-end residential home automation to pursue my passion for software development. There is nothing I like more than a challenge and the immense satisfaction I take in solving a problem.

Having graduated from [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com) -a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp-, I look forward to joining a company where I can make a difference as a junior developer, contibuting with my skills and **positivity**. I subscribe to **Agile/XP** values, and would like to carry on pairing and test-driving development in my work as a software engineer.

## Skills

#### Analitical Thinking

  * Strive to simplify complex tasks/concepts by breaking them down into smaller and simpler units. I use plain English to solve a problem at an abstract level first, then translate my solution into concrete code, using tests to drive the development.
  * Extensive use of diagrams to map out the systems/concepts I face to more easily reason about them. I ran a workshop on diagramming for Junior students at Makers Academy. See [this link] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations/tree/master/diagramming_presentation) to the presentation.
  * Designed and overlooked the installation of large-scale residential audio-video-lighting control systems. 

#### Clean code

 * Take pride in the code I produce and always ask myself if it could be made simpler, more efficient and easier to understand.
 * Endeavour to write code that is easily extensible and reusable, most often choosing modular over monolithic. I wrote about this in a [blog post] (https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/11/i-smashed-my-headphones-and-now-i-am-a-better-programmer/).  
 * Attention to detail, including choice of names. I carefully pick the clearest, most descriptive and least ambiguous name I can think of, trying to put myself in the shoes of future developers. 
 * Have recently been asked and wrote a blog post about what I deem 'good quality' in code. Here is a [link to the post](https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/what-is-good-quality-code/). Highlights: Simplicity | Human-readibility | Modularity | Ease of change | Squint test | Least surprise.

#### Communication

  * Pair programming is one of the best things ever discovered. I balance assertiveness and humbleness to achieve the best code out of the pair. Multiple humans are so much better at solving a problem than a single one is. See an [article I wrote](https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/04/good-programming-good-people/) about this.
  * Am capable of adapting to the person I am relating to, with experience in a variety of contexts, from ultra-high net worth individuals as a Project Manager, through Architects as a Design manager and peer programmers at Makers.
  * Enjoy teaching/mentoring as a mean to self-improvement and to enable others in growing their knowledge and processes.  
  

#### Problem solving

  * Have troboulshooted several systems, both as a Maker and in my previous roles as Live Sound Engineer and Design Manager.
  * Approach problem solving with focus and calm; am able to take a step back and take a fresh approach when necessary.
  * Follow a scientific method by observing the problem , then formulating hypotheses, finally testing them in order of most likelyhood.

## Community

Together we are stronger, and by helping others grow, we grow as well.

As a member of the community I have both enjoyed learning from passionate senior developers and giving back as much as I can.

* Coaching volunteer at [Codebar] (https://codebar.io/), a non-profit initiative running workshops for underrepresented groups. 
* Arranged and ran workshops for junior students at Makers Academy. See [this link] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations/tree/master) to my presentations.  
* Member of the London Software Craftmanship Community. Evening pairing sessions are my favourite.
* Frequently attend meetups to learn, hear about new technologies and exchange opinions. See a [post] (https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/18/meetups-are-the-bomb/) I wrote on this.
