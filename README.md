I am **curious** about most things. This drives me to learn more everyday and deepen my understanding of what I already know. I have come to appreciate and actively seek **feedback** as this helps me improve faster, both as a person and a developer. I am allergic to any code that _is not_ well crafted, clean, clearly named, modular and simple. If I work on a codebase with any of these attributes, I try to leave it in a better state than I found it.

**Passion** is what drives me. I have moved away from a succesful career in high-end residential home automation to pursue my passion for software development. There is nothing I like more than a challenge and the immense satisfaction I take in solving a problem.

Having graduated from [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com) -a 16 weeks intensive coding bootcamp-, I look forward to joining a company where I can make a difference as a junior developer, contibuting with my skills and **positivity**. I subscribe to **Agile/XP** values, and would like to carry on pairing and test-driving development in my work as a software engineer.

## Community

Together we are stronger, and by helping others grow, we grow as well.

As a member of the community I have both enjoyed learning from passionate senior developers and giving back as much as I can.

* Coaching volunteer at [Codebar] (https://codebar.io/), a non-profit initiative running workshops for underrepresented groups. 
* Arranged and ran workshops for junior students at Makers Academy. See [this link] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations/tree/master) to my presentations.  
* Member of the London Software Craftmanship Community. Evening pairing sessions are my favourite.
* Frequently attend meetups to learn, hear about new technologies and exchange opinions. See a [post] (https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/18/meetups-are-the-bomb/) I wrote on this.
