## Community

Together we are stronger, and by helping others grow, we grow as well.

As a member of the community I have both enoyed learning from passionate senior developers and giving back as much as I can.

* Coaching volunteer at [Codebar] (https://codebar.io/), a non-profit initiative running workshops for underrepresented groups. 
* Arranged and ran workshops for junior Makers Academy students. See [this link] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations/tree/master) to my presentations.  
* Member of the London Software Craftmanship Community. Evening pairing sessions are my favourite.
* Frequently attend meetups to learn, hear about new technologies and exchange opinions. See a [post] (https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/18/meetups-are-the-bomb/) on this.
